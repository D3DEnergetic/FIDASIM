title: Devices using FIDASIM

#DIII-D
FIDASIM is being used at DIII-D for simulating and validating their FIDA, NPA and neutron diagnostics.
It it also being used in charge exchange recombination spectroscopy to validate deuterium density measurements.

The routines for running a DIII-D FIDASIM run are available [here](https://github.com/D3DEnergetic/d3d-fidasim)

A FIDASIM module containing the DIII-D specific routines is available on the Iris cluster.
```
module load fidasim
fidasim
```

#NSTX-U
FIDASIM is being used at NSTX-U for simulating and validating their FIDA and NPA diagnostics.

The routines for running a NSTX-U FIDASIM run are available [here](https://github.com/D3DEnergetic/nstx-fidasim)
